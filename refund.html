        <h2>Cancellation Requests</h2>
        <p>Cancellations will only be considered if the request is made within 1 day of placing the order. However, cancellation requests may not be entertained if the orders have been communicated to such sellers/merchants listed on the Platform and they have initiated the process of shipping them, or the product is out for delivery. In such an event, you may choose to reject the product at the doorstep.</p>

        <h2>Non-Cancellable Products</h2>
        <p>Divine Guide does not accept cancellation requests for perishable items like flowers, eatables, etc. However, a refund or replacement can be made if the user establishes that the quality of the product delivered is not up to standards.</p>

        <h2>Damaged or Defective Products</h2>
        <p>In case of receipt of damaged or defective items, please report the issue to our customer service team. The request would be entertained once the seller/merchant listed on the Platform has checked and determined the same at its own end. This should be reported within 1 day of receipt of products.</p>

        <h2>Incorrect Products</h2>
        <p>If you feel that the product received is not as shown on the site or does not meet your expectations, you must notify our customer service within 1 day of receiving the product. After reviewing your complaint, our customer service team will make an appropriate decision.</p>

        <h2>Warranty Products</h2>
        <p>In case of complaints regarding products that come with a warranty from the manufacturers, please refer to the issue directly to them for resolution.</p>

        <h2>Refund Process</h2>
        <p>In case of any refunds approved by Divine Guide, it will take up to 7 days for the refund to be processed and credited to you.</p>
